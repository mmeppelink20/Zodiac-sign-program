# Matthew and Ethan Pair Programming 3a

What is Pair Programming
Pair programming is a method of programming in which two people work together to code. One person, "the driver", types at the keyboard. The other person, "the observer" (or "navigator") reviews each line of code as it is typed, checking for errors and thinking about the overall design. Switch roles oftenâ€”every 10-15 minutes.

The Challenge
In this activity, you and your partner are going to write a program that will allow a user to input their date of birth and print their zodiac sign. The month variable must be a String ("January", "February", etc.) and a day variable must be an int (1, 2, etc.).
